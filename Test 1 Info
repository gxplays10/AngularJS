ng-app here considers the application as angularJS application.
Controller holds the business logic.
Message is a member variable created here.
Script tag here is used to write the angular js code within it.
Controller here is 'HelloWorldCtrl' //angular.module("app", []).controller("HelloWorldCtrl", function($scope)  

we are creating a controller here named helloworldctrl which holds the business logic..
Inside the controller we create a function which gets executed when the controller is called.
$scope object is used to manage the data between controller and view.

We have created a member named 'message' which has the value set to Hello world..This member is attached to the scope variable $scope.
